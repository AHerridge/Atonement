# Welcome!

Visiting a new church can be a little intimidating.
We hope the following information will help you feel a little more at home.

## What should I wear?

We want you to wear whatever you are comfortable in.
You will see women in dresses, skirts, slacks, and jeans.
Men wear suits and ties, dress shirts and slacks, and yes - even jeans.

## How long will the service last?

Services generally last about 1 hour.

## Will I be able to follow along and participate in the service?

Our services are projected so everyone can follow along and participate.

## Can I bring my children?

Atonement loves and welcomes children.
We understand that different families have different ideas about having children in worship.
We try to provide a comfortable setting to fit everyone's personal desires for their children.
Your children are welcome to stay in the sanctuary with you.
We provide a staffed nursery just in case your little wiggler might need some time and space to move around.
