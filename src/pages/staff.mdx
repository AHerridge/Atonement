Sherri has this to say about her work at Atonement:

“I wake up every day and thank God that I get to work in such a great place!
The people I work with are kind, generous, talented, passionate, and FUN! My favorite thing about my job is our child care center and preschool.
I get to see the children every day and watch them learn, play, and grow.
You just can’t have a bad day when children are playing nearby.“
